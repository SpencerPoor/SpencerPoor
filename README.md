### **Description:**

The **Pride Farm web app** is a **full-stack app** designed to provide a platform for the Pride Land Non-Profit Organization to communicate and advertise their farm in Kawasaki, Japan. It's a close collaborative effort between our development team of four and the **Pride Land NPO**. 

The app features a user-facing front-end designed to inform the user about the farm's ongoing mission, and can inquire about the farm and submit forms to volunteer directly through the app's respective pages, and that data is sent to a **hidden sister front-end designed exclusively for Pride Land's administration** to manage the website and handle user data.

Additionally, there is a **companion game called "Prideland Shitake"** which provides a fun way for users to pick mushrooms, engaging with one of the physical activities volunteers do at the actual farm.
