## üë®‚Äçüíª Volunteer Code Work

### Mozilla Firefox
From my support of Mozilla's mission and being an avid user of their products, I regularly contribute code to Mozilla's Firefox web browser codebase to support the growth of the Firefox browser and to learn new insights about working with such a large and storied repository.

I've been assigned to and contributed code to resolve issues such as:<br/>
-Streamlining browser management logic by consolidating duplicated functionality across multiple components<br/>
-Enhancing error reporting for JavaScript evaluation by including line and column information for easier debugging<br/>
-Adding a new assertion method to improve code reliability by ensuring arrays are non-empty when expected<br/>
-Implementing a helper function to simplify the process of verifying whether a browsing context is a top-level context

And other similar functionalities.<br/>

### **Description:**

The **Pride Farm web app** is a **full-stack app** designed to provide a platform for the Pride Land Non-Profit Organization to communicate and advertise their farm in Kawasaki, Japan. It's a close collaborative effort between our development team of four and the **Pride Land NPO**. 

The app features a user-facing front-end designed to inform the user about the farm's ongoing mission, and can inquire about the farm and submit forms to volunteer directly through the app's respective pages, and that data is sent to a **hidden sister front-end designed exclusively for Pride Land's administration** to manage the website and handle user data.

Additionally, there is a **companion game called "Prideland Shitake"** which provides a fun way for users to pick mushrooms, engaging with one of the physical activities volunteers do at the actual farm.
